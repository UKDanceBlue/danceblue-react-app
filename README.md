<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

DanceBlue is a University of Kentucky student-run organization that fundraises
year-round and culminates in a 24-hour no sitting, no sleeping dance marathon.
The money raised through DanceBlue is donated to the Golden Matrix Fund,
established to support the kids of the DanceBlue Kentucky Children’s Hospital
Hematology/Oncology Clinic both today and well into the future through an
endowment. DanceBlue funds also support the year-long fundraising engine
and operations that underpin the mission, as well as providing funds to
support research at the UK Markey Cancer Center. The Golden Matrix Fund
was created to benefit the DanceBlue KCH Hematology/Oncology Clinic patients
and families. Childhood cancer not only affects the child physically, but it
also creates many emotional and financial difficulties for the entire family.
The goal of the Golden Matrix Fund is to provide care and support for the kids
through giving them and their parent’s comfort.
